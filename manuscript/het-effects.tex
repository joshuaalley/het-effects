%Heterogeneous effects are common in social science. 
This note describes why, when, and how to use Bayesian hierarchical models to estimate heterogeneous effects. 
While an ample literature suggests that hierarchical models provide helpful regularization and information about effect variation, political scientists rarely use them to estimate heterogeneous effects. 
Doing so is simple, however, and starts with identify the key sources of heterogeneity. 
Then, researchers should fit a hierarchical model with two linked regressions, one connecting treatment with the outcome, and another that models the treatment effects with potential sources of heterogeneity and partially pools individual estimates.
This captures systematic and random variation in heterogeneous effects, encompasses the diversity of interactions in theories, and fits commonly used modeling frameworks. 
Hierarchical modeling is more flexible than linear interactions and reduces the risk of underpowered subgroup comparisons.
It also provides a more interpretable framework for testing theories than machine-learning tools. 
I document these claims with a simulation analysis and extension of a published study. 
Researchers can thus use hierarchical models alongside other approaches to understand heterogeneous effects for scholarship and policy.

\section{Introduction}


% one: het effects matter
Whether in observational or experimental studies, every independent variable social scientists examine impacts some units differently than others. 
Common estimands aggregate heterogeneous effects.\footnote{For instance, \citet{Abramsonetal2022} note that the average marginal component effect (AMCE) of conjoint experiments gives more weight to intense preferences.} 
Such average effects are useful, but they often obscure interesting and important variation. 


Understanding heterogeneous effects is essential for policy and scholarship. 
Estimating heterogeneity allows scholars to clarify when an independent variable most or least impacts some outcome.
Policymakers can maximize the impact of finite resources with targeted interventions, for example by providing job training to individuals who are more likely to benefit. 
% expand/sharpen this, if there is space. (There is not for PA) 

% two: introduce my solution 
This paper explains why, when and how to use hierarchical models to estimate heterogeneous effects. 
A large statistics literature suggests that Bayesian hierarchical models are a useful tool for  heterogeneous effects estimation (e.g., \cite{FellerGelman2015, McElreath2016, Dorieetal2022}).
Political scientists tend to rely on interactions or machine learning tools instead, however.  
For instance, of the three applied political science citations of \citet{FellerGelman2015}, only \citet{Marquardt2022} models treatment effects. 


% power problems
This oversight matters because there are few tools that are well-suited to test the proliferation of conditional arguments in the social science. 
Social scientists often propose conditional theories \citep{ClarkGolder2023} and are interested in how different people respond to the same stimulus for normative or policy reasons.
Many theories proposing distinct modifiers for the same independent variable and interest in diverse subgroups suggest that multiple modifiers are the rule, not the exception.  
For example, scholarship on audience costs has considered how foreign policy dispositions \citep{KertzerBrutger2016}, partisanship \citep{LevenduskyHorowitz2012}, gender \citep{Barnhartetal2020, SchwartzBlair2020} and policy preferences \citep{Chaudoin2014} modify individual reactions to a leader backing down from a threat.
Such proliferation of theoretically informed modifiers complicates empirical testing, however. 


Scholars cannot ignore heterogeneity, but the most common tools either increase the risk of spurious results or are hard to interpret and use. 
Interaction terms and subgroup analysis are the most common tool. 
Simple interactions and subgroup analyses are ubiquitous because they are relatively easy to interpret, but they have serious power concerns. 
Many political science analyses have low power even to detect main effects \citep{ArelBundocketal2022}.
Adequate power for estimates of even a single interaction can require significantly more data \citep{Gelman2018}, which may be prohibitively expensive or impossible.
As a result, statistically significant heterogeneous effect estimates may be far too large--- the result of noise in the data, not systematic differences. 
This problem is partially responsible for widespread issues replicating findings based on interactions \citep{Simmonsetal2011}. 


Even when theory implies that scaling up the number of modifiers is necessary, doing so with interactions is not easy. 
The interpretation benefits of interactions diminish as researchers add modifiers.
Adding variables to an interaction further raises the risk of spurious inferences due to power concerns and picking up noise in ever more finely sliced subgroups.


% three: loads of techniques
Given multiple sources of heterogeneity, machine-learning tools such as random forests \citep{GreenKern2012, WagerAthey2018}, support vector machines \citep{ImaiRatkovic2013}, and ensemble methods \citep{Grimmeretal2017, Kuenzeletal2019, Dorieetal2022} are more likely to avoid over-fitting.
These machine learning algorithms usually have some regularization component and can discover complex patterns and high-dimensional variation across multiple modifiers.\footnote{\citet{BlackwellOlson2022} describe a lasso approach to interactions that sits between machine learning and linear regressions.}
These tools can be difficult to interpret and implement, however, especially in smaller social science datasets. 
A lack of interpretability is especially problematic for testing the relative weight of multiple modifiers. 


The hierarchical strategy I propose here addresses the power shortcomings of interactions while retaining more theoretical structure than machine learning.
I do this by showing how scholars can use two connected regressions to estimate theoretically informed models of heterogeneous effects.
Using hierarchical models is more flexible than standard interactions but easier to implement and interpret than machine learning approaches.  
It preserves a straightforward structure while accommodating more factors and ameliorating the downsides of subgroup analysis. 
This facilitates argument testing.
The main downside is that unlike machine learning, the hierarchical approach lacks the flexibility to discover high-dimensional heterogeneity. 
It also may not scale to very large datasets, depending on the underlying sampler.
Hierarchical modeling therefore works best when theory indicates more than two modifying factors and there is less emphasis on discovery.\footnote{\citet{Goplerud2021} introduces a model that uses Bayesian structured sparsity to estimate which group coefficients are similar and which are different. In this approach, researchers use theory to inform potential groups, but the data determines common estimates for groups.} 


Hierarchical modeling has an additional benefit of bridging the disparate estimates of interactions and machine learning. 
Many interactions functionally estimate grouped effects--- individuals with the same values of the modifiers will have the same effect estimate. 
Machine learning models usually estimate individual effects. 
The model I propose here gives individual estimates with the systematic group component and a way to account for and regularize individual deviations from those groups.


There are two key steps when theory and data make using hierarchical models worthwhile.
First, researchers should identify potential modifiers of a treatment and use them to model treatment effects.
Second, they should take that model of treatment effects and connect it to a model linking individual treatment effects and the outcome.
Modeling heterogeneous effects in this way produces interpretable results, which facilitates argument testing.
It also allows researchers to compare different sources of heterogeneous effects and describe how much an effect varies.  
These are crucial advantages in a world with many conditional theories.


While frequentist estimation of hierarchical models is possible, Bayesian estimation is easy, usually fast, and more informative.
Bayesian estimation provides crucial information by connecting parameters through common prior distributions, thereby regularizing estimates and propagating uncertainty. 
Working with posterior distributions also gives researchers more flexibility to describe how and when effects vary. 
While computation and coding were once a barrier to employing Bayesian methods, fitting a wide range of hierarchical models is straightforward with the brms package in \textsf{R} \citep{Buerkner2017}.\footnote{I provide example code below and in the appendix.}
%Calculating substantive effects is also simple \citep{ArelBundockme}.



% wrap and introduce the application 
In the remainder of this paper, I describe how and when to estimate hierarchical models of heterogeneous effects.
I then employ a simulation study to compare OLS and hierarchical estimates of individual treatment effects under different conditions.
Finally, I demonstrate the process by analyzing a study of how military alliances shape public support for war by \citet{TomzWeeks2021}. 
The reanalysis reveals that alliances exert the strongest impact on respondents with high internationalism and interest in the news. 
It also documents how regularization can shift conclusions about small subgroups based on combinations of experimental treatment.
%Alliances increase mass support for war by impacting individuals who otherwise prefer peaceful collaboration. 



\section{Hierarchical Modeling of Heterogeneous Effects}


There are two steps in hierarchical models of heterogeneous effects. 
First, researchers must identify potential sources of heterogeneity, and think about the right model of heterogeneity.
This will also depend on what variation is most important and interesting. 
Theory, policy concerns, or normative factors are all possible motivations. 


This first step determines what heterogeneous effects a researcher estimates. 
It is analogous to researchers thinking through their regression specifications--- the same sort of care should go into the sources of heterogeneity. 
Researchers need to define what variation is most important, links heterogeneous effects to theory, and structures modeling.\footnote{It also facilitates pre-registration when applicable.}
Not thinking carefully about sources of heterogeneity will obfuscate results and can hinder model fitting.
   

% three ways to set groups
There are three general approaches to defining key modifiers.  
First, researchers can use combinations of other treatments, especially when an intervention has several dimensions but theory emphasizes one of them. 
The experimental design determines modifiers, and the model estimates heterogeneous treatment effects.   
If researchers want to know how different issues shape the impact of elite foreign policy cues \citep{GuisingerSaunders2017}, they could include indicators of issues, for instance.
A similar application of hierarchical estimators for topic-sampling experiments estimates how a treatment effect varies across different topics \citep{CliffordRainey2023}. 


The most common practice in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is fully crossed interactions.
This estimates the impact of a treatment across experimental strata, but risks spurious results by functionally estimating subgroup results.
Most social science experiments do not have adequate power for main effects \citep{ArelBundocketal2022}, let alone small subgroups that may only include 50 or fewer data points.


A second approach uses unit, demographic and contextual factors to estimate effect heterogeneity. 
Here, researchers examine what factors within or around units shape their response to an independent variable.
Researchers could use a mix of individual and contextual factors to predict divergent consequences of a survey experiment treatment. 
Such a model might include factors such as an indicator of state of residence, age, gender, and race.\footnote{Extrapolation to a representative sample for geographic might require poststratification.}


For example, \citet{Alley2021isq} uses alliance characteristics to examine when alliance membership increases or decreases military spending.
He models the impact of alliance participation as a function of treaty depth, partner democracy, conditions on military support, issue linkages, democratic membership, foreign policy concessions and other factors. 
All of these variables are potential sources of credibility or confounding factors.
Democratic alliances have higher depth \citep{Martin2005}, so this model of heterogeneity accounts for potential confounding, and finds that after accounting for depth, democracy does not impact the relationship between alliances and defense spending, contrary to \citet{DiGiuseppePoast2018}.


Third, researchers might use hierarchical models to address specific policy concerns.
Policy analysts often want to know how an intervention impacts a specific population. 
Researchers might want to know if a job-training program improves employment outcomes for black women in the South, for instance.  
To do this, a researcher might specify a heterogeneous effects model with race, gender and region, plus additional controls or other factors.

%CUT CANDIDATE
%Interacting modifiers can be a useful component of this hierarchical approach.

% grouping factors: numbers 
%Whether researchers use other treatments, context, or policy to determine what drives heterogeneity, group composition should depend first on the research question.
%There are some practical constraints, however.
%Using too many factors can lead to model fitting and interpretation problems by creating many small groups.
%How many factors is too many depends especially on the data- some datasets can support reasonably large groups for many factors. 
%At the other extreme, using only one grouping factor in a hierarchical model will usually add relatively little value compared to interactions. 


After defining moderators and how they relate to individual effects, the second step is fitting a hierarchical model that links a model of the outcome with a model of heterogeneity.
Essentially, researchers model the outcome and the process that produces heterogeneous treatments. 
The model employs two connected regressions.
One regression deals with the outcome.
The other regression models the treatment effects.\footnote{If other units such as states define the groups, rather than combinations of modifying variables, then adding group-level predictors is essential. For examine, in a model where an effect varies by state, adding state-level variables like ideology, population and GDP would avoid partially pooling small groups too far towards the overall mean.}


I now briefly describe the generic hierarchical model. 
For ease of exposition, consider making between-unit comparisons based on an experimental treatment.    
Start with \textit{N} units indexed by \textit{i}, some of which receive a binary treatment \textit{T}.
Assume that the outcome variable ${y}$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu_i$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.\footnote{Researchers can and should use binary, categorical and other outcome likelihoods.}
%\textit{g} indexes two researcher-defined groups, \textit{g1} and \textit{g2}.


%The first equation predicts the outcome mean. 
The outcome for each unit depends on an overall intercept, an optional matrix of control variables \textbf{X}, and a set of individual treatment effects $\lambda_i$.
When \textit{T} is binary, estimated $\lambda$ parameters for untreated units have no impact on the outcome. 
For a continuous treatment, the impact of of treatment will depend on the product of $\textit{T}_i$ and $\lambda$.



\begin{align*}
y_i &\sim N(\mu_i, \sigma) &\text{(Likelihood)} \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \lambda_i \textit{T} + \textbf{X} \beta &\text{(Outcome Equation)}  \\ 
\lambda_i &= \theta_i + \textbf{Z} \gamma  &\text{(Heterogeneity Equation)}\\
\theta_i &\sim N(\mu_\theta, \sigma_\theta) &\text{(Indiviudal Varying Intercepts)} 
%\gamma &\sim N(0, 1) &\text{Problem-Specific Prior} \\ 
%\beta &\sim N(0, 1) &\text{Problem-Specific Prior} \\ 
%\alpha &\sim N(0, 1) &\text{Problem-Specific Prior} \\ 
\end{align*}



%The outcome for each unit is then a function of group varying intercepts $\alpha_g$, an optional matrix of control variables \textbf{X}, and a set of group treatment effects $\theta_g$.
%The researcher divides all units into \textit{g} groups based on unique combinations of heterogeneous effect predictors \textbf{Z}. 
%Each $\theta$ parameter estimates how the treatment effect varies across the values of  each variable.  
%To capture correlations between the random intercepts and varying slopes $\rho \sigma_\alpha \sigma_\theta$, these variables should have a common multivariate normal prior.

%\begin{align*}
%y_i &\sim N(\mu_i, \sigma) &\text{(Likelihood)} \\
%\mu_i &= \alpha + \alpha_{g1} + \theta_{g1} \textit{T} + \alpha_{g2} + \theta_{g2} \textit{T} + \textbf{X} \beta &\text{(Outcome Equation)}  \\

%%\alpha_g &= \alpha_{g1} + \alpha_{g2} & \text{(Group Intercepts)} \\
%%\mu_\theta &= \lambda_0 + \textbf{Z} \lambda &\text{(Heterogeneous Effects)} 
%\end{align*}
%
%This approach lets slopes vary across groups. 
%This is a relatively simple model.\footnote{In brms for a model with no controls and two groups modifying the impact of a treatment, the model formula is y $\sim$ 1 + (1 + treat | group1 + group2)}  
%Researchers could modify this to fit panel data, account for autocorrelation, or make any other necessary adjustments.
%
%
%The slopes and intercepts can also be nested via interactions of grouping variables. 
%In that instance, the net impact of the treatment in each group depends on the linear combination of slopes in that group, specifically the $\theta$ parameters at the specific values of each variable. 
%Similarly, the group intercepts would be the sum of the corresponding random intercepts for each grouping variable.

%The heterogeneous effects equation then predicts the treatment effects with the matrix \textbf{Z}, which contains unique combinations of whatever variables define the groups.  
%As a result, each $\theta$ reflects a unique mix of factors that modify the treatment.
%The second equation also includes an intercept $\lambda_0$ that estimates the impact of treatment when all sources of heterogeneity are zero.\footnote{In brms for a model with no controls and two variables modifying the impact of a treatment, the model formula is y $\sim$ 1 + treat*(var1 + var2) + (1 + treat | var1:var2). treat*(var1 + var2) expresses part of the second equation, while (1 + treat | var1:var2) lets slopes vary by group.}

The heterogeneity equation then models those individual treatment effects with a systematic and random component. 
The systematic component is a matrix of predictors \textbf{Z} and associated parameters $\gamma$. 
$Z$ can mirror any regression specification researchers might use for an outcome; linear combinations of variables, interactions, or other terms such as varying intercepts. 
Researchers might use interactions to capture processes where combinations of modifiers produce non-additive jumps in heterogeneity. 


The random component of the heterogeneity equation is a series of individual-specific varying intercepts $\theta_i$.
These are critical, because they capture individual-specific deviations from the systematic trends expressed in the design matrix \textbf{Z}. 
Individual outliers that otherwise might bias the $\lambda$ estimates are partially pooled back towards the overall mean $\mu_\theta$.\footnote{In brms, using non-linear syntax can express a model with a treatment, two controls, and three modifiers as: y $\sim$ lambda * treat + controls, lambda $\sim$ mod1 + mod2 + mod3, controls $\sim$ coutrol1 + control2, nl = TRUE}


The above model can be fit with Bayesian or frequentist methods, but Bayesian estimation offers important advantages.
First, it is more flexible, and including prior information can facilitate model fitting and convergence. 
Putting priors on the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ parameters is especially helpful.
Priors also help regularize estimates by pulling extreme groups towards the overall mean.
Working with posterior distributions also also provides a wealth of information about effect heterogeneity and propagates uncertainty.  


% Interpretation 
In interpreting these estimates, researchers should leverage the full range of information from the different parameters. 
First, the $\lambda$ posteriors give the impact of the treatment on each individual, and are the core quantity of interest. 
All $\lambda$s reflect a systematic component from the predictors in $\textbf{Z}\gamma$ and a random variations from $\theta$. 
$\gamma$ parameters can, depending on the regression, be interpreted as the impact of a change in a modifier on the treatment effects.
For example, a $\gamma$ of .1 on a binary modifier means that $\lambda$ is .1 higher in expectation when the modifier is one, and .1 lower when it is zero.
$\sigma_\theta$ thus measures the extent of individual variation that is outside the systematic regression. 
Other techniques such as interactions in OLS with robust standard errors provide less information.


\section{When to Use Hierarchical Models}

% advantages 
In deciding whether to use a hierarchical model, researchers must weigh specific advantages and disadvantages. 
In general, estimating heterogeneous effects in this way has three advantages.
First, researchers can make detailed inferences about heterogeneous effects in an interpretable framework. 
This helps examine theories that predict how an effect varies and compare sources of variation.\footnote{Rescaling variables in the heterogeneous effects equation can aid model fitting and coefficient comparisons \citep{Gelman2008}.} 
Partial pooling also facilitates reasonable estimates for small groups by sharing information across groups and incorporating predictors in the heterogeneous effects equation. 
Finally, this approach will be faster than machine learning approaches for many datasets as well as easier to use in small datasets.


% disadvantages
Like all methods, the hierarchical approach has downsides, some of which can be ameliorated with modifications, while others should lead researchers to use different tools. 
Extremely complex specifications can lead to model fitting problems.
Sometimes, fitting problems indicate that the model is misspecified, so these problems can be a blessing in disguise.


Furthermore, hierarchical models can show general trends, but will not make powerful comparisons between every treatment effect. 
Researchers who want to compare specific effects will often lack empirical leverage.
This downside can also apply to other methods, however. 


% Relative to interactions
With these considerations in mind, when should researchers use hierarchical models in place of interactions?
If only one factor modifies an effect, interactions are best, as the extra information hierarchical models provide is less valuable. 
Researchers should still remember power concerns with interactions, however. 


% two modifiers
With two or more modifiers, hierarchical models begin to add value beyond. 
Interpreting triple interactions between a variable and two modifiers is challenging. 
The advantages of hierarchical modeling increase with the number of modifiers, so long as model complexity does not hinder accurate fitting and simulation from the posterior. 

% not as well suited for discovery 
The relative use cases of hierarchical models and machine learning are different. 
Unlike machine learning approaches, hierarchical models will not discover high-dimensional interactions. 
Researchers can add flexibility with additional interactions or non-linear specifications in either level of the model, but this requires a priori specification. 
Therefore, if researchers want to focus on flexible discovery, not testing an argument with multiple sources of treatment heterogeneity, they should rely more on machine-learning. 


Data size is relevant to model selection as well. 
Machine-learning approaches work especially well with large, often massive datasets. 
Interactions also benefit from more data, as it can help overcome power problems. 
Hierarchical models also benefit from more data, but are less sensitive to outliers in small samples. 
In very large datasets, some hierarchical models may take hours to fit. 


In summary, researchers should continue to use interactions for single modifiers and machine learning to discover complex interactions. 
Hierarchical modeling works well when there are two or more modifiers and researchers have adequate data to support an informative model.  
\autoref{tab:tools-det} summarizes some relevant characteristics of hierarchical, interaction and machine learning approaches to heterogeneous effects. 
Hierarchical modeling is thus an intermediate tool between interactions and machine-learning, where researchers need more flexibility than interactions but are not willing or able to tackle the computational and interpretation challenges of machine learning.

\section{Performance on Simulated Data}

To assess how hierarchical models compare to interactions in OLS models, I first assess their performance on simulated data. 
The first simulation manipulates variation in the treatment effects and outcome, while leaving the number of groups fixed.
Adjusting these factors changes the potential benefits of regularization.
To second simulation varies the same aspects of the data-generating process and also manipulates the number of groups.
Both simulations use 1,000 observations, so increasing or decreasing the number of groups changes the number of data points in each group.


The first simulation defines groups based on fully crossed interactions of five binary variables. 
I base the group treatment effects on interactions between the treatment and a dummy indicator for each group. 
I simulate the interaction coefficients by drawing them from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of .05, .25 or .75. 
Increasing the standard deviation adds greater variation to the group-level effects.
This captures the degree of heterogeneity in the relationship.


The interactions predict the mean of the outcome variable, $\mu_y$, which has a standard deviation of .05, .25, or .75. 
The key treatment effect is the difference in $\mu_y$ between treatment and control observations within each group. 
I use differences in $mu_y$ as the true value because this is the systematic component of the simulation- the observed outcome $y$ has a random component. 


I then fit two models. 
First, I fit an OLS model that uses interactions of the grouping dummies with the treatment variable.
Next, I fit a hierarchical model that estimates varying intercepts and treatment slopes across groups.


There are several potential metrics for comparing model performance \citep{Hopkinsetal2024}.
One is bias; the gap between the estimated treatment effects in each group and the true treatment effects. 
Hierarchical models are sometimes biased on average, however \citep{CliffordRainey2024}, and the question is whether reduced variance in the estimates offsets bias enough to improve the estimates.
To assess that, I compare the root mean squared error of the group treatment effect estimates for each model. 
Improvements in the root mean squared error suggest that that reduced variance overcomes any bias in the hierarchical estimates, improving overall model performance \citep[pg. 39]{Hopkinsetal2024}.
In the appendix, I show some other performance statistics, including...


\autoref{fig:sim-rmse-coef-nsd} summarizes the results of the first simulation.
This figure plots the difference in root mean squared error between the hierarchical and OLS estimators. 
Negative values favor the hierarchical model, while positive values mean OLS performs better.


\begin{figure}[htpb]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{../figures/sim-rmse-coef-nsd.png}
	\caption{Difference in root mean squared error between hierarchical and OLS estimators of heterogeneous effects with different levels of random variation in the heterogeneous effects and outcome. Positive values favor OLS, and negative values favor hierarchical modeling. Simulations based on 1,000 observations with 32 unique groups.}
	\label{fig:sim-rmse-coef-nsd}
\end{figure}


When the outcome has low variance, OLS and hierarchical models perform similarly. 
This implies that regularization is most important when the outcome is noisy. 
Hierarchical models offer slight improvements at the next highest level of outcome variance, regardless of how much variance there is in the coefficients themselves. 
Hierarchical modeling produces the largest gains at the highest levels of outcome variance, especially when the coefficients vary less than the outcome.
As is often the case, the regularization benefits of hierarchical modeling are greatest when there is substantial noise in the data-generating process. 
OLS estimates of heterogeneous effects are more sensitive to random variation in the outcome.


In the second simulation, I define between 2 and 6 groups in a dataset with 1,000 observations.
Each group has the same number of data points, so as the number of groups increases, the number of observations in each group falls. 
More and smaller groups will likely benefit more from regularization, improving the performance of hierarchical modeling.


\autoref{fig:sim-rmse-coef} summarizes the results of the second simulation.
Again, this figure plots the difference in root mean squared error between the hierarchical and OLS estimators, and negative values mean that the hierarchical models performs better.
Because the number of observations is fixed, as the number of grouping variables rises, the size of the groups falls. 
For instance, with two grouping variables, there are 250 observations per group.
With seven grouping variables, there are 7 or 8 observations per group.

\section{Example Application: Alliances and Public Support for War} 


In the following, I demonstrate how the hierarchical approach works and the benefits of regularizing effect estimates by reanalyzing a study by \citet{TomzWeeks2021}. 
Tomz and Weeks (TW hereafter) examine whether the public is more willing to go to war for an allied country.
In a factorial experiment with vignettes, they find a 33\% average increase in support for military intervention on behalf of another country if that country is an ally. 
This is a large and potentially important relationship because the United States has a global network of allies. 


Given the size of the main effect, TW's paper is an ideal scenario for comparing interactions and hierarchical models. 
Corresponding interaction effects may be large, and their sample size of 1,200 respondents is not unusual in published work. 
At the same time, TW estimated an array of interactions to check how other treatments modify the impact of alliances.
There are 64 unique treatment groups with anywhere from 11 to 32 respondents, so estimates of the impact of alliances in the 32 pairs of alliance treatment and control groups employ at most 54 data points. 
As such, hierarchical regularization will likely offer substantial benefits, because the small groups will likely lead to noisy estimates.
I document these gains by analyzing how other experimental treatments modify the impact of alliances, and then exploring how demographic differences modify the alliance treatment. 



\subsection{Differences by Experimental Scenario}


Along with alliances, TW randomly assign whether the potential beneficiary of U.S. intervention is a democracy or not, the stakes of intervention, the potential costs, and the region of the world. 
They estimate the impact of alliances in the 32 treatment conditions with an OLS model that fully crosses interactions between the treatments, and calculate marginal effects over different averages of these groups. 
I use a hierarchical model to estimate the impact of alliances, with fully crossed experimental treatments as the systematic modifiers of the alliance effect.
This mirrors TW's model, but adds a regularization component to the heterogeneous effects of alliances.

	\caption{Comparison of OLS and hierarchical estimates of the impact of alliance across experimental conditions. The top panel gives a histogram of the treatment effects from each model. The bottom panel gives the difference between the hierarchical and OLS estimates for each group.}
	\label{fig:tw-het-treat-comp}
\end{figure}


\autoref{fig:tw-het-treat-comp} compares the estimated alliance treatment effects across the experimental groups with the OLS and hierarchical models.
This figure illustrates the regularization benefits of hierarchical modeling by showing the difference between the median hierarchical estimate and the OLS estimate for each combination of treatment groups and plotting the distribution of effects.
Both facets give a sense of when and how regularization is useful. 


First, the hierarchical estimates are much less variable, despite producing many more estimates. 
The hierarchical model estimates 602 non-zero alliance treatment effects, while the OLS model has 184 unique estimates, yet the hierarchical estimates are much more tightly clustered around the overall mean.
This occurs because the OLS model mechanically forces individual treatment effect estimates to the value of the coefficients and corresponding subgroup means point. 
Given the size of this sample, the treatment effects are based on comparisons of roughly 25 treatment and 25 control respondents. 


Second, the hierarchical estimates pull in unusual values.
The bottom panel of \autoref{fig:tw-het-treat-comp} shows the difference between the median hierarchical estimate among individuals and a group and the OLS estimate for that group, which applies to all individuals in each group.
The downward slope from positive to negative values means that the hierarchical estimates are larger than below average OLS estimates, but smaller than above average interaction estimates. 
This occurs because hierarchical estimates are pulled towards the overall mean, away from extreme and implausible values such as a 60\% effect for alliances when there are low stakes, low costs and a democratic partner in Africa.

	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{../figures/tw-het-treat-source.png}
	\caption{Comparison of OLS and hierarchical estimates of the impact of alliance across experimental conditions. Each point gives the typical effect estimate, specifically the median of the individual effects in the hierarchical model.}
	\label{fig:tw-het-treat-source}
\end{figure}


Partially because it regularizes the estimates, the hierarchical model also leads to slightly different conclusions about when alliances matter most.
I compare the estimates for each group more precisely in \autoref{fig:tw-het-treat-source}.
For some conditions, such as a high-stakes, high-cost intervention to support a democracy, the hierarchical estimate is as much as 30\% greater than the OLS estimate. 


In other groups, regularization pulls down very large estimates. 
For instance, TW highlight a very large positive effect of alliances on support for low stakes, low cost interventions to help an autocracy, but that effect is closer to 20\% in the hierarchical models, not the 46\% effect that TW report. 


These changes, which deal with a very large average effect, do not change the direction of the findings- in some scenarios they even strengthen them. 
However, the magnitudes of some subgroup estimates do matter, as they might lead observers to misidentify when alliances matter most.
For other, smaller effects, regularization with a hierarchical model might change the direction of a subgroup analysis. 


\subsection{Who Responds to Alliances}


To further explore the potential application of hierarchical models, this section examines how demographic factors modify the impact of alliances.
I used party, political interest, race, gender, hawkishness, and internationalism to modify the impact of alliances.
I selected these variables because foreign policy dispositions like militant assertiveness shape willingness to use force \citep{Kertzeretal2014} as do gender \citep{Barnhartetal2020} and race, while Tomz and Weeks examine party and political interest as potential modifiers. 
I control for other experimental manipulations.


The resulting hierarchical model thus encompasses four subgroup comparisons in TW's appendix, as well as additional information about other demographic factors. 
Doing all of the comparisons encapsulated in the hierarchical model would require at least six pairwise interaction models. 
Following TW's OLS analysis, I use a Gaussian likelihood, although the outcome is a binary variable. 


To start, I plot the two regressions of hierarchical model. 
\autoref{fig:tw-het-source} plots how different variables shape either the impact of an alliance or support for intervention. 
One facet of this figure gives the coefficient estimates from the model of heterogeneity, and a second gives the control estimates. 



\begin{figure}[htpb]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{../figures/tw-treat-het-source.png}
	\caption{Variation in the impact of alliances on support for military intervention across four variables that set groups. Each point marks the impact of alliances on a specific group, and boxplots summarize the median and interquartile range of the slopes within each level of the variable. All slopes are present in each facet.}
	\label{fig:tw-het-source}
\end{figure}


Internationalism and news interest most accentuate the impact of alliances on support for war. 
A one-unit increase in internationalism increases the impact of the alliance treatment on support for war by .1 in expectation, with a 95\% credible interval that ranges between .07 and .14. 
Hawkishness is also correlated with higher support for war, but not as largely or clearly. 
Respondents with high news interest also respond to alliances by .1 more than others in this survey, and that relationship could be as small as .03 or as large as .18.
This differs from TW's conclusion that respondents with high and low news interest respond in roughly the same way, likely because the hierarchical model accounts for other factors that are correlated with news interest.


Other demographic predictors do not differentiate responses to alliances as clearly. 
The impact of alliances may be somewhat greater for white and male respondents, but those differences are not clearly different from zero as the 95\% credible intervals include zero and small negative values.
Similarly, Republicans and Democrats are not all that different from independents in how they respond to alliances.
This matches TW's conclusion that partisanship does not create substantial differences in alliance effects.
The intercept in this equation can be theoretically meaningful, but it is not in this case because neither internationalism nor militant assertiveness take a value of zero. 


The control equation suggests that high stakes, high costs, and partner democracy all increase support for intervention.
Region is less consequential, as neither Asia, Eastern Europe nor Africa is clearly different from the reference category of Latin America.
As with any regression, the intercept here gives the impact of alliances when all the other variables are equal to zero, and this indicates that alliances increase support for war by .26 given low costs, low stakes and an autocracy in Latin America.
The 95\% credible interval of this intercept estimate includes the corresponding hierarchical estimate of the alliance treatment in \autoref{fig:het-treat-source}.


\begin{figure}[htpb]

	\caption{Estimated impact of alliance on support for military intervention in different subgroups of respondents. The shaded area in each tile shows whether the median estimated treatment effect was clearly positive, and the text gives the exact median estimate.}
	\label{fig:tw-treat-het-joint}
\end{figure}


While it is possible to construct a rough profile of who responds most to alliances using the estimates in \autoref{fig:tw-het-source}, I provide a more precise summary in \autoref{fig:tw-treat-het-joint}. 
This figure plots the median estimate in each group of respondents, after grouping respondents based on race, gender, news interest and foreign policy dispositions.
Darker fill indicates a positive effect that has a credible interval excluding zero and negative values.
Some combinations of demographic data are blank because they are missing from the data. 


Alliances most impact white men with high internationalism, high militant assertiveness, and high interest in the news. 
The largest median estimate of an alliance impact is .7. 
At each level of internationalism, alliance impact increases by .1, which was the coefficient value in the heterogeneity regression.
News interest generates a similar shift in the median alliance impact across all groups. 
The marginal role of hawkishness is also apparent in substantial differences from low to high hawkishness.


The weakest impact of alliances, including some that cannot be distinguished from zero, occur at minimal internationalism and low news interest. 
Non-white females with these views are especially unlikely to respond to alliances. 
Otherwise, most demographic groups respond somewhat to TW's alliance treatment, but how much depends on their interest in the news and blanket support for international engagement.
Alliances are unlikely to decrease support for intervention, at least in this experiment, and that is itself an important consideration.


% variation
These results show some potential uses of the hierarchical approach to heterogeneous effects.\footnote{In the appendix, I analyze \citet{BushPrather2020}.}
Regularization moderates what might otherwise be extreme inferences about experimental subgroups.
It also provides useful inferences about treatment heterogeneity that account for overlap among different sources of heterogeneity.



\section{Conclusion}


This note paper how and when to use hierarchical models to estimate heterogeneous effects. 
Bayesian modeling can apply to a wide range of outcomes, data structures, and theories. 
It also details what drives variation in an effect and how much an effect varies. 
Explicitly modeling how different groups respond to an independent variable can help test arguments and inform policy.  


Hierarchical modeling provides an intermediate approach between interactions or subgroup analyses and machine learning algorithms. 
For interactions with one or perhaps two modifiers, relying on simple interaction tools is best. 
Machine learning is best for discovery of complex heterogeneity.
When there are two or more theoretically informed modifiers, hierarchical modeling allows flexible and interpretable estimation of effect variation. 


As a result, hierarchical modeling complements existing tools and should not replace them. 
Researchers can use hierarchical models to check and inform other techniques, for instance by seeing if a key interaction holds when there are multiple modifiers, or comparing multiple modifiers that past theories have identified. 
Using hierarchical modeling can thus help scholars and policymakers better understand heterogeneous effects.
